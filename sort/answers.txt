sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?:
We first conclude that sort3 uses Selection sort and sort2 uses Merge therefore sort1 must use Bubble sort.
But we also see that it takes significantly less time to sort the sorted list compared to sorting the random and reversed lists
which tells us that it uses Bubble sort because we know that it's sorting algorithms are:
O(n^2)  Omega(n)

random50k - 7.72s
reversed50k - 5.73s
sorted50k - 0.53s

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?:
Sorts the random list way faster than the others and takes approximately the same time to sort the sorted list.
O(nlogn)  Omega(nlogn)

random50k - 0.44s
reversed50k - 0.69s
sorted50k - 0.51s

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?:
Takes longest to sort the sorted list and approximately the same time to sort the random list.
O(n^2)  Omega(n^2)

random50k - 3.30s
reversed50k - 3.36s
sorted50k - 3.423
