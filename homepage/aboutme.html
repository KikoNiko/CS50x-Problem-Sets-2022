                        <h3><u>Here is a short story about my life.</u></h3>
                        <p>
                            In Bulgaria I grew up in a medium-size town called Asenovgrad.
                            When I was in high school I thought I wanted to be a civil engineer.
                            So when I graduated I went off to Sofia to study that in university.
                            But after the first year I already had changed my mind. Living in Sofia I started cooking for myself
                            and really enjoyed it. Also being a student I had the chance to go to USA for a Work and Travel program. Twice.
                            That way I discovered my love for travelling.
                            And so it made sense to me that becoming a chef it would also be easier for me to travel from time to time.
                            And that is what I did.
                            Since then I've visited more than 20 countries, worked in 4 different countries
                            and in 2021 I started my own small business in my hometown Asenovgrad.
                            The end of this summer I sold my business and now I am headed in a totaly different direction, exploring my new pasion - Programming!
